			<li>
				<a href="t-40">t-40</a>: I'm drawing a blank on this theme. But I'm planning to code a 3d game from scratch using WebGL, so let's do some project setup and render a pink sphere.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-39">t-39</a>: Still no idea for the game, so let's spend the time writing a phong shader for my sphere.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-36">t-36</a>: Maybe I'll do a platformer with a level that has a upper and an underside.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-35">t-35</a>: Wrote some basic platformer controls, camera and collision code.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-33">t-33</a>: Add a texture to my player sphere.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-29">t-29</a>: End of day 1. I'm feeling burnt out, but had an idea about connecting parts of the level.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-15">t-15</a>: After a long rest, I have the energy to continue. To start, I coded up a skybox with mountains.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-12">t-12</a>: Implemented a level "loader" (from json in the sourcecode).
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-8">t-8</a>: Added signal sources and sinks + a second signal color.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="t-6">t-6</a>: Spend 1.5h recording some music. Improvised Acapella.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="index.html">final (ca. t-3)</a>: After putting all my remaining energy into designing some levels, I still have some ideas and there is still time, but I can't bring myself to write another line of code.
			</li>
